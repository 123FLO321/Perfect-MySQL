# Perfect - MySQL Connector

[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/PerfectlySoft%2FPerfect-MySQL.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/PerfectlySoft%2FPerfect-MySQL)

This project provides a Swift wrapper around the MySQL client library, enabling access to MySQL database servers.

This package builds with Swift Package Manager and is part of the [Perfect](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect) project. It was written to be stand-alone and so does not require PerfectLib or any other components.

Ensure you have installed and activated the latest Swift 3.0 tool chain.

## OS X Build Notes

This package requires the [Home Brew](http://brew.sh) build of MySQL.

To install Home Brew:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

To install MySQL:

```
brew install mysql
```

Unfortunately, at this point in time you will need to edit the mysqlclient.pc file located here:

```
/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/mysqlclient.pc
```

Remove the occurrance of "-fno-omit-frame-pointer". This file is read-only by default so you will need to change that first.

## Linux Build Notes

Ensure that you have installed libmysqlclient-dev for MySQL version *5.6 or greater*.

```
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
```

Please note that Ubuntu 14 defaults to including a version of MySQL client which will not compile with this package. Install MySQL client version 5.6 or greater.

## Building

Add this project as a dependency in your Package.swift file.

```
.Package(url:"https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MySQL.git", versions: Version(0,0,0)..<Version(10,0,0))
```

## Repository Layout

We have finished refactoring Perfect to support Swift Package Manager. The Perfect project has been split up into the following repositories:

* [Perfect](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect) - This repository contains the core PerfectLib and will continue to be the main landing point for the project.
* [PerfectTemplate](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectTemplate) - A simple starter project which compiles with SPM into a stand-alone executable HTTP server. This repository is ideal for starting on your own Perfect based project.
* [PerfectDocs](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectDocs) - Contains all API reference related material.
* [PerfectExamples](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectExamples) - All the Perfect example projects and documentation.
* [PerfectEverything](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectEverything) - This umbrella repository allows one to pull in all the related Perfect modules in one go, including the servers, examples, database connectors and documentation. This is a great place to start for people wishing to get up to speed with Perfect.
* [PerfectServer](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectServer) - Contains the PerfectServer variants, including the stand-alone HTTP and FastCGI servers. Those wishing to do a manual deployment should clone and build from this repository.
* [Perfect-Redis](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Redis) - Redis database connector.
* [Perfect-SQLite](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-SQLite) - SQLite3 database connector.
* [Perfect-PostgreSQL](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-PostgreSQL) - PostgreSQL database connector.
* [Perfect-MySQL](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MySQL) - MySQL database connector.
* [Perfect-MongoDB](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MongoDB) - MongoDB database connector.
* [Perfect-FastCGI-Apache2.4](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-FastCGI-Apache2.4) - Apache 2.4 FastCGI module; required for the Perfect FastCGI server variant.

The database connectors are all stand-alone and can be used outside of the Perfect framework and server.
